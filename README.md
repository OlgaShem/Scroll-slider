I have made possibility to change cards by scrolling on the desktop and switching by tabs on mobile. I'm having some problems with switching by tabs on desktop, I will try to fix it.

I know the code could be better, I can put out cards as a components or optimized js script but I need extra time for it.
I didn't use any libraries, tried to do all the logic by myself on JS.

I would be glad to get feedback about my code!
